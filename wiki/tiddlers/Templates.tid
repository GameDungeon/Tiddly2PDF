The template tiddlers are pure html with a few values that are dynamically replaced. These are currently very limited, expect a major expansion in the future. 

In the ''header template'' those values are:

* ''$currentPage'' - Is replaced with the page number
* ''$pageCount'' - Is replaced with the page count

In the ''footer template'' those values are:

* ''$currentPage'' - Is replaced with the page number
* ''$pageCount'' - Is replaced with the page count

In the ''background template'' those values are:

In the ''page template'' those values are:

* ''$title'' - Is replaced with the tiddler's title
* ''$body'' - Is replaced with the html of the tiddler's content
